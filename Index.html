    Visual Studio Code is a code editor in layman's terms. Visual Studio Code is “a free-editor that helps the programmer write code, helps in debugging and corrects the code using the intelli-sense method ”. In normal terms, it facilitates users to write the code in an easy manner. Many people say that it is half of an IDE and an editor, but the decision is up to to the coders. Any program/software that we see or use works on the code that runs in the background. Traditionally coding was used to do in the traditional editors or even in the basic editors like notepad! These editors used to provide basic support to the coders.

    Some of them were so basic that it was very difficult in writing basic English level programs in them. As time went by, some programming languages needed a specific framework and support for further coding and development it, which was not possible using these editors. VI Editor, Sublime Text Editor, is one of the many kinds of editors that came into existence. The most prominent and which supports almost every coding language is VISUAL STUDIO CODE. Its features let the user modify the editor as per the usage, which means the user is able to download the libraries from the internet and integrate it with the code as per his requirements.
